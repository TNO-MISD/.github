# 🌞 MISD Project Chantico — Energy‑Aware Cloud‑Native Operator

Chantico is a Kubernetes operator focused on bringing energy intelligence 
to modern, cloud-native data centers. Built as part of the Modular 
Integrated Sustainable Datacenters (MISD) project, Chantico provides 
a fully declarative way to discover, configure, and monitor physical energy 
measurement devices.

By mapping power consumption across a graph of services and workloads, 
Chantico enables accurate attribution of energy usage to customer-provided 
services, simplifying administration and reducing dashboard clutter.

Our mission is to make sustainable cloud operations effortless.

## 🚀 Goals

- Become aware of and configure physical measurement devices
- Monitor power consumption across PDUs, servers and cluster workloads
- Attribute energy usage to customers and tenants
- Integrate with other workload orchestrators and domain-aware controllers

In the end, we support sustainable operations via workload migration to 
green energy sources.

## 🤝 Becoming a Committer

We welcome issues and discussions for our project. Initially, we will not seek 
external contributions via Pull Requests. At this stage in the project it is 
considered too early to accept external work, given pending design changes and 
major technology choices. Once we are more mature, we welcome contributions 
that align with our scope and vision of the Chantico project. Have a look at 
our [contribution
