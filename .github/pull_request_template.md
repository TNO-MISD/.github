## Merge request

- **Title:** title
- **Description**: description

In order to support semantic releases, please use [conventional 
commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) with any case you 
prefer for the type in the commit comment title, such as "fix" or "Feat".

### How to test?

Explain how to test.

### Code quality measures as stated in [TNO Coding Principles](https://codingguild.tno.nl/coding-at-tno/#coding-principles).

###### Readable
- [ ] The code meets our coding standards and styling guidelines.
- [ ] Comments explain the purpose behind the code's functionality.
- [ ] Commented-out code has been either removed or documented with inline
      comments explaining why the code has been commented-out.

###### Documented
- [ ] New features have been documented.
- [ ] For APIs, changes to interfaces have been documented.
- [ ] For APIs, changes to interfaces are consistent with other interfaces in
      the codebase.
- [ ] APIs adhere to industry standards.
- [ ] Changes to the repository's structure and way of working have been
      documented.
- [ ] New input or output formats and values have been documented, including
      constraints and units.
- [ ] Any non-standard reasons for pinning dependencies to specific versions
      have been documented.

###### Reproducible
- [ ] Changes to dependencies are reflected in the dependency management file.
- [ ] Dependencies are pinned to suitable (ranges of) versions to prevent future
      installations from failing due to new (breaking) dependency releases.
- [ ] Changes to hardware, infrastructure, or deployment requirements been
      documented.
- [ ] Any file extensions of new binary files have been added to Git LFS via
      the `.gitattributes` file.

###### Reusable
- [ ] New code has been put in the right (modular) place in the codebase.
- [ ] New functionalities can be easily enabled or disabled during runtime using
      methods such as a configuration file, command line arguments, or
      environment variables.
- [ ] None of the new dependencies use incompatible licences.

###### Tested
- [ ] Unit tests reflect the changes in the code.
- [ ] Integration tests reflect the changes in the code.
- [ ] The code has been tested in the environment it will be used in, and
      screenshots have been added to the merge request to show this.
