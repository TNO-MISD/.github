# Default Community Health Files

This repository contains the organization-level [community health
files](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file) 
for the open source organization of [TNO-MISD](https://github.com/TNO-MISD) on 
GitHub.

Repositories owned by this organization on GitHub will use these files, such as 
`CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` if there are no own versions of 
these health files configured.

Furthermore, this repository contains the [organization's 
profile](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile).

We manage the community health files, public profile and other files in this 
repository in an internal GitLab repository which is mirrored to this 
repository.
